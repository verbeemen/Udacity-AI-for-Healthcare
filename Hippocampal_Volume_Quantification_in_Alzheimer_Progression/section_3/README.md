# Integrating into a Simulated Clinical Network

In this final section I tried to create an AI product that can be integrated into a clinical network.  
Basically, I've tried to calculate the Hippocampal volumes for unseen data.   
And provided this information, along with the masked Hippocampal into the OHIF application.
