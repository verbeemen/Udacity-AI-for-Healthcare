**Your Name:** Dieter Verbeemen

**Name of your Device:** The Chest X-Rays Pneumonia Notifier

## Algorithm Description

### 1. General Information

**Intended Use Statement:**
Notify (help) radiologist detect pneumonia

**Indications for Use:**
- The image must be a X-ray
- The X-ray image must be a DICOM file
- The X-ray image must be taken from the chest
- The X-ray image must be taken in the AP or PA position
- The patient, man or women should be between 1 and 90 years old


**Device Limitations:**
- Any modern computer with a standard CPU, although a GPU is advised

**Clinical Impact of Performance:**
- The best use for this model is to prioritize the worklist.
- The model has a low precision and a higher recall.
  - (Recall) This means if we have 100 patients with pneumonia,  
Then we can properly classify these 100 patients as a positive event.  
(without classifying them too much as _no pneumonia_).
  - Unfortunately, the precision is not very high. This means that  
we will also classify healthy patients as pneumonia.
 - However, if we want to prioritize our worklist then we should prioritize our ill patients above  
   the healthy patients (recall). But it isn't harmful to classify a healthy person with pneumonia.

### 2. Algorithm Design and Function

**DICOM Checking Steps:**
- Modality must be "DX"
- Body part examined must be "CHEST"
- Patient Position must be "PA" or "AP"

**Preprocessing Steps:**
- Image is normalized between 0 and 1
- Image is reshaped to a 224 x 224 image
- Image is repeated across 3 channels

**CNN Architecture:**

```python

*Model info:*
- The model contains out of 2 parts:
 - Part 1) A pre-trained [VGG16 model](https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/):
    - A 16 layer pre-trained convolutional neural network based on imagenet.  
      The weights are not trainable.
 - Part 2) Four dense layers, each with its own dropout layer

**Final Threshold and Explanation:**

* Threshold: 0.37415
* F1 Score: 0.46824

The final threshold of 0.37415 was based on the highest F1-Score of 0.46824.
Based on [this paper: CheXNet: Radiologist-Level Pneumonia Detection on Chest X-Rays with Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05225.pdf),   
the average radiologist had a F1 Score of 0.387. This means that our model achieved a better F-1 score than the average radiologist. _(Please note that we have no information about who these radiologists were and whether they are representative of all radiologists..)_
